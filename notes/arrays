1. Dynamic arrays
arrays - arrays that have a fixed size. 
int [] array = [1,2,3] 
array.add(1) //not permitted 
array.remove(1) //not permitted  <- arrays are static, which means they will always have a fixed length designated at assignment.
 
int[3] array = [1,2,3];
int[] array = this.getSomeArray() // fixed  

ArrayLists - arrays that have a dynamic size. 
int array = new ArrayList<int>(); 
array.add(1)
array.remove(1) 

Arraylist = static list that always multiples in two when it reaches its capacity.
array = [1,2,3,4,5]  maxCapacity = 5
array.Add(1)  -> arraylist multiples by 2 
newArray = [1,2,3,4,5,1, , , , ]
adding will be O(N) 
retrieval of element will awlays be O(1)ffm
